Response to Exercise 1:

	Replacing the interrupt handler code for INT_SYS_GETPID with schedule()
instead of run will have no effect on the output. The pid of of the current
process is saved in that process's eax register.

	Calling the schedule subroutine runs an arbitrary process that is 
runnable, which would include the process that called the interrupt handler.
The scheduler copies the appropriate registers which would include the pid
saved in eax and then runs the process. 

	Since the process register state is saved on system calls and that state
is loaded before scheduling that process to run, the result will be the same.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anything else you'd like us to know:

  Blocking is implemented in the sys_wait interrupt handler code. If process
"current" is waiting on a process that has already exited, this process
state will be marked as "P_ZOMBIE" indicating that it exited but its exit
status has not been consumed. In this case, the current process can safely
read the exit status, but then must change that process state to "P_EMPTY".
 
 If current is waiting on a process that has not completed, it changes its
state to "P_BLOCKED", then assigns the pid of the proecss it is waiting on
to its eax register. This is the key to determining when to wake up the
current process. Finally, the interrupt handler calls the scheduler to 
run a runnable process.

SYS_EXIT:
 When a process calls the sys_exit subroutine, the interrupt handler
iterates over each process in the proc_array, if the process is marked
as "P_BLOCKED" and its eax register matches that of exiting process, that
process is unblocked. In this case, the exiting process is removed from
proc_array marked as "P_EMPTY".

 If there is no process that is blocked by the exiting process, then the
status of this process is marked "P_ZOMBIE" to indicate that its exit
status has not been consumed by any waiting process.
